Deep Learning: Neural Networks
----------
a workbook of exercises from Michael Nielsen's book
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

network.py contains code for NN with backprop and stochastic gradient descent code from chapter's 1 and 2.  

networ_matrix.py is the matrix generalization of the backprop algorithm.  As stated in the book it is significantly faster because of optimized BLAS routines.
